#### On Licklider’s *Man-Computer Symbiosis*

In this essay Licklider presents the current (well, his “current” by the time this was written) absence of and a ideal vision of a much more smooth, intuitive, “organic” interaction between human and computer. He calls it “symbiosis” much like his example of fig tree and one kind of wasp. Naturally we may come up with the doubt that computer, does not really need human. Certainly, computers require power  in order to operate properly, but the very reason computers are made and then plugged into the power grid is to serve us in one way or another. Computers do not rely on human, at least not in the same way as we rely on computers. But, if we steer away from this “consciousness” philosophical dilemma, Licklider does offer a good discourse on how human and machine can cooperate more efficiently, that is to combine the respective strengths of the two and supplement each other, for a collective goal. (Again, not that a machine needs a goal.) 

This ideal situation differs from “mechanically extended man” or “semi-automatic systems” where there are few interactions. This situation requires constant interactions between man and computer that will form loops of information exchange which not only tackle mechanical and repetitive work but also will foster the process of decision-making or interllectual thinking. I am particularly font of Licklider’s idea that such interaction resembles working with “a colleague whose competence supplements your own.” In order to achieve such level of cooperation, man and computer should at least communicate seamlessly. 

Again, we may gain better understanding of it by making another analogy. Think of man and computer as two people who speak different languages, and they would work more closely and efficiently through a third language that both of them speak, or body language that to some extent convey meanings universally. And that is the signifance of inventions like the graphical user interface, touch screen, Scratch language, or even any basic high-level programming language to some extent. They, as the “third language”, serve as a midpoint between the world of human and the world of machine where the two could meet with fewer obstacles. 

Over the years, this midpoint has shifted more and more towards the world of us, of course, for all these works are set to be done in our favor. If we look at this matter of man-machine communication in a “human-centralism”, such shift enables more people that aren’t so familiar with technology to enhance their living experience more seamlessly with the help of computers and other electronic devices that are being invented daily nowadays without much learning cost.
